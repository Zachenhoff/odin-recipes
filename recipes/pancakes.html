    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt (or more to taste)</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather and measure all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Make a well in the center, then add the milk, melted butter, and egg. Stir until the batter is smooth.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a griddle or frying pan and place it over medium-high heat. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the hot surface. Cook until bubbles form on the top and the edges look dry, about 2–3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancakes and cook the other side until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings and enjoy!</li>
