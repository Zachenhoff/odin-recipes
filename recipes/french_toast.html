    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This French Toast recipe will make the most tasty fluffy French Toast you will ever have! It's secret ingredient is all-purpose flour, which binds the liquids together, creating a more traditional 'batter,' helping prevent sogginess. All-purpose flour makes sure the French toast is crispy on the outside, but fluffy and soft on the inside</p>
